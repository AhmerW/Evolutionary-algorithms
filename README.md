# Evolutionary-algorithms
 A basic evolutionary algorithm implemented in C (soon Java).
 Implemented as a part of the course IN3050 (Machine learning) (and IN2140 - C)

## Configuration
 Program parameters are defined in the header file definitions.h
 and the fitness function in variation.c (int fitness).


## Goals
 Make this more complex and able to work on other types of problems with other representations.
 Currently only works with binary representations.
